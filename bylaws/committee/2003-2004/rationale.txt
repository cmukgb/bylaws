Required individually-addressed mailings -- so not necessarily
individual messages, but certainly not a post to, say, assocs.kgb.
For the commentary, we should note that the Corresponding Secretary
should make a reasonable attempt to track down the unaddressable
(for instance, after an email bounce), but that ultimately it's
a member's responsibility to maintain a valid listing.

Removed proxy voting entirely, but provided a clearer and more usable
absence mechanism.  We were heavily influenced by Robert's on this; in
particular, we removed all absentee-voting procedures from
non-elections on the principle that such decisions tend to involve
participatory debate, and that any voter making such a decision ought
to be present for the debate.

Vague proxy rules have led to troubling situations in the past, not as
much with the idea of proxies as with ambiguities over accepting them
at all.  Election proctors have decided not to accept them, only to
have members insist on being permitted to use them (after others with
similar time-pressures had left, presuming that they would not be able
to acquire proxies).  It was judged that a firmer rule was important
to maintain fairness.

Absentee ballots, of course, are to be ignored as long as the actual
member is present.

Robert's has rules governing the absence of presidents, in which

We have thus restored the intent of the law by removing it.

The Corresponding Secretary has risen over the Recording Secretary
in seniority, mostly to allow us to prove this theorem:  the
Recording Secretary will never be forced to preside over a Board
meeting (modulo chairs stepping down) and, thus, to hand over the
duties of keeping the minutes.

The proof is fairly simple:  at a Board meeting, there must be 4
officers present, and so (as there are only 2 officers less senior
than the Recording Secretary) one officer must be more senior than
the Recording Secretary.
Aha! you say.  But what if the Recording Secretary is absent and the
Corresponding Secretary has taken over the minutes?  Then there still
can only be 2 officers present who are less senior than the
Corresponding Secretary, and so one officer present must still be more
senior.
Aha! you say.  But what if both are absent?  Well, then it's
impossible for the the presiding officer to need to take the minutes,
as the highest non-presiding officer acts as the Recording Secretary.

As regards the Acting Recording Secretary mechanism: it was only our
intent to make sure the job was done -- if the Board wishes to appoint
a pro tempore Recording Secretary instead of relying on this
mechanism, it is still free to do so.

We also made explicit that the Recording Secretary played the role of
Secretary under Robert's Rules.

Again, absentia cases.  Of course, this job falls to the acting
Recording Secretary in the case of his/her absence.

This was a fairly controversial proposal; in effect, we reached a tie,
and I relented to allow the General Body to render judgment upon it.
Part of the desire for the requirement is to impose a sort of term
limit on officership (and thus to require fresh blood); another part
is to maintain a strong tie to CMU, on the presumption that other
KGB-like groups should form their own chapters.

Changed to file with the Board rather than the Recording Secretary.
Otherwise, fixed wording and notification issues.

Proctor selection and replacement rules, clearly developed and spelled
out.  We decided to allow external proctors as an escape method that
we don't expect KGB will really want to use often -- hopefully never,
since it implies a fair chasm of dispute in the organization for a set
of internal proctors to not be sufficiently trustworthy.

We have proctor pre-selection to allow proctors the chance to organize
the elections and study the bylaws.  More proctors are required in
random emergency selection mostly to "ensure" fairness, given that
random emergency selection is most likely to occur in exactly the sort
of dispute listed above.  Candidates are not disqualified if they are
selected in the very last clause of (c).

Also, changed some wording ("chain of command"?) and formatting.

Formalized the concept of general-body committees as "extraordinary"
committees, and thus executive-board committees became "ordinary"
committees.

Same again.  Formalized the "owner" system to closely follow current
practices.  Specifically required the Recording Secretary to keep
track of committees.
