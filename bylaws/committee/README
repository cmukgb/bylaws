This is the recommended layout of these directories:

Any general comments or suggetions for the Bylaws Committee,
independent of term, should be placed in this parent directory.  It is
assumed that this will be an immediate subdirectory of a directory
containing the various editions of the Bylaws.

Subdirectories for information specific to a certain term of the
committee should be placed in a subdirectory named YYYY-ZZZZ, those
respectively being the beginning and ending calendar years of the
appropriate KGB organizational year.  These directories should contain
the following files:
  activities.txt
    A roster of the current membership, chair, and any relevant
    nonmembers who participated;  a description of any activities
    by the committee and their attendance/participation;  a
    description of an actions taken by Exec and/or the general body
    with regards to the proposals.
  previous.txt
    A symlink to the bylaws as they stood before any deliberations.
  revision-N.txt
    The proposed text of the bylaws as they stood after the Nth
    deliberation of the committee, for some meaning of the word
    "deliberation".
  proposal.txt
    A symlink to either the revision file which was proposed or
    to previous.txt if no proposals were eventually made.
  outcome.txt
    A symlink to either the revised bylaws file or to previous.txt
    if all proposals were rejected.  If proposals were made at
    multiple meetings, these should be named outcome-N.txt.
  rationale.txt
    A file documenting the reasons for the changes made.
Any other documents maintained by the committee should be stored
likewise, except with a well-known identifier prefixed.  For example,
if the committee maintained a file called 'commentary', the third
revision of that document by the current term of the committee would
be called "commentary.revision-3.txt".

The following are the current supplementary documents maintained by
this committee:
  commentary
